# BookStore

This is a .NET 8 MVC project that i started to learn mvc.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.

4. Open 'appsetting.json' and change the connection string based on your server(changing server name is enough if u just want to run the program).
